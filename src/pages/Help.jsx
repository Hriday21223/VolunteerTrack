        <FaqItem
          question="How do I enable two-factor authentication (2FA)?"

        />
        <FaqItem

          answer="On the login screen, after entering your password, click 'Use a backup code instead' and enter one of the 10 backup codes you saved during 2FA setup. Each code works once. If you don't have backup codes, use the password reset flow from the login page."
